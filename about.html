      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Kat. I am based in Lexington, KY. I am currently in the process
        of getting my Master's in Computer Science as well as a graduate
        certificate in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Eastern
        Kentucky University with an expected graduation date of December 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received my Bachelor's from Asbury University in Spanish Language &
        Composition in 2017. Shortly after, I taught English as a foreign
        language in Gwangju, South Korea until the end of 2018. For the last
        five years, I have worked for the federal government in dual capacities.
        From 2018 to 2022, I worked as a Spanish Interpreter and Document
        Translator for the Social Security Administration. In 2020 I was
        selected to attend Officer Candidate School for the U.S.Army and have
        worked as an Operations Officer and Platoon Leader for a transporation
        company ever since.
